# Advanced Cosmology and Extragalactic Summer School
## 2-6 September 2025, **University of Sussex**, Brighton, UK

We are pleased to announce the STFC funded Advanced Cosmology and Extragalactic School (ACES) to be held at the University of Sussex 2-6 September 2024 (accomodation available on 1 September). ACES is targeted at STFC funded PhD students undertaking projects in cosmology and extragalactic astronomy. The aim of ACES is to update participantsâ€™ knowledge of current topics in cosmology and extragalactic astronomy and provide training in state-of-the-art tools and techniques. 

## Programme

The ACES programme will include:
- lectures on the current status of the field and upcoming facilities.
- workshops on numerical simulations, cosmological inference, something theoretical cosmology, SED fitting, and public engagement.
- an excursion to the [Observatory Science Centre](https://www.the-observatory.org) in Herstmonceux, East Sussex. The Observatory Science Centre occupies the home of the Royal Greenwich Observatory from 1957-1990.
- a set of short presentations and networking session with astronomy graduates working outside academia.

A full programme will be available [here]() shortly.
